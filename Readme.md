# MACAW - Syntax Highlighter in Swift

**Macaw** is the simplest syntax highlighter you can find in Swift. 

I was looking for a simple syntax highlighter and found SourceKit, SourceKitten and SourceKittenDaemon plus and outdated OysterKit, but they were too complex for my need so I decided to make one. I love one file libraries because they're easier to copy and implement in your pet projects without downloading a gigabyte of dependencies.

So here is Macaw Syntax Highlighter, not the best of the pack but it works and that's more than enough for me.

Why Macaw? Because Macaws are beautiful and colorful parrots, that's why.
